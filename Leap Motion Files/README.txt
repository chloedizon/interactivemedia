Even though you wont be able to test the leap motion functionality,
you will still need this to not get errors when running the code
once my changes are implemented.

Intructions to install Leap Motion SDK:

	1 - Locate your processing.js root files, should have files like 'examples', 'libraries', 'modes', etc.

	2 - Navigate into the 'libraries' folder, if there isn't one, create one with the exact name 'libraries'.

	3 - Copy the entire 'LeapSDK' folder from this directory into the 'libraries' folder.

	4 - Done! Now the import statement should work.


Notes:

	~ I'm going to make our app work with both mouse and Leap Motion, but you still need this to not get errors :)
